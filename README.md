# What I learned/practiced
- Regular Expressions! I was able to use them to sort the arithmetic expression into operands and operators.
- Debugging using VS Code and where to insert breakpoints. Helped me to figure out what was wrong with the evaluate function when sorting tokens into their respective arrays.
