# Intro

This calculator was built as a part of the curriculum for The Odin Project. I've left it on the backburner for too long and now I'm dead set on getting it finished.

# Learning objectives

Using fundamental JS knowledge and applying it to build an HTML calculator

# What I learned/practiced

- Javascript, HTML/CSS
- Regular Expressions! I was able to use them to sort the arithmetic expression into operands and operators.
- Debugging using VS Code and where to insert breakpoints. Helped me to figure out what was wrong with the evaluate function when sorting tokens into their respective arrays.
- Adding keydown events using Javascript

# To Do

- Fix the CSS and make it look more sleek
- Fix calculator layout
- Add keyboard functionality
